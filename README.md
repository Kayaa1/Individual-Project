# Individual Project

This repository contains the materials for an undergraduate project focused on analyzing battery data using digital signal processing and deep learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

### Data Folders
- `datasaved`: Contains saved outputs from different stages of the project.
- `evaluate_result`: Stores performance metrics and evaluation results of the deep learning models.
- `NASA_Battery_dataset`: The NASA-sourced dataset utilized for the project.

### Model and Utilities
- `pretrained_model`: Stores the model saved after training.
- `util_function`: Includes utility functions for data processing and model training.
- `Model_pretraining.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that pre-trains all the models and evaluates their performance.
- `Autoencoder_dim_proved.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that identifies the optimal autoencoder dimensionality for the best performance.
- `model_architecture.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that visualizes the architecture of each model.

### Data Pre-processing
- `LowPassFilter_datapreprocessing`: Contains MATLAB scripts for data pre-processing using low-pass filters.
- `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook detailing the steps for data pre-processing.

### Graphs
- `graph`: Consolidates all graphs referenced in the project report.
- `graph_datapreprocessing`: Includes graphs from the data pre-processing stage, merged into the `graph` folder.
- `graph_model_architecture`: Contains graphs of the model architecture, also merged into the `graph` folder.
- `graph_postprocessing`: Comprises graphs from the post-processing stage, integrated into the `graph` folder.

### Project Management
- `Gantt_Chart.xlsx`: A Gantt chart for managing project timelines and progress.
